This one actually boots all the way to trying to find a rootfs.
FAN53555 is a [M]odule on this one, as I had a hint on IRC that this seemed to be related to kernel hangs for some other people.
Note: since my kernel doesn't find a rootfs, the module is never loaded - so it may still cause a hang when eventually loaded.

Note: parameters used disable cpufreq and cpuidle. This may not be required. Also, it still includes debug params, which most likely can be removed.

What IS required is: clk_ignore_unused  or it will hang when disabling unused clocks (no idea why)

Note: I compiled a linux-rockchip kernel from kernel.org with tag v4.16 with this config.

Warning: This kernel fails to recognise any SD or eMMC partitions (I did not try USB), so it's fairly broken.
